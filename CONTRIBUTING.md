## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (for MCP servers)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/devkit.git
   cd devkit
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**

   ```bash
   nx --version
   nx prepush
   ```

4. **Review project setup and structure**
   - Run through local setup and run the app (see [project docs](./docs/agenstra/README.md) for entry points)
   - Understand the repository layout and how to run tests and builds

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow the project’s code quality and security practices
- Use conventional commits for commit messages (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- Ensure all tests pass and code is properly formatted

### Architecture Guidelines

- Respect application and library boundaries
- Follow domain and dependency rules
- Use Nx for all build, test, and lint tasks

### Nx Workflow

- Use `nx` commands for all operations
- Run `nx affected` to test only changed projects
- Use `nx format:write` for code formatting
- Run `nx prepush` before committing

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Planning

- Check existing issues and discussions
- Create an issue for significant changes
- Discuss your approach with maintainers if needed

### 2. Development

- Create a feature branch from `main`
- Follow our development guidelines
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Testing

- Run the full test suite: `nx prepush`
- Test affected projects: `nx affected -t test,build,lint`
- Verify your changes work as expected

### 4. Submission

- Create a pull request using our template
- Ensure all checklist items are completed
- Request review from maintainers
