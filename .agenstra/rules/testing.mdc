# Testing

## Strategy

- Unit tests for business logic and utilities
- Integration tests for APIs and data flow
- E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Aim for a defined minimum coverage on production code (e.g. 80%)

## Conventions

- Test layout mirrors source layout where practical
- Use descriptive test names; use arrange/act/assert where helpful
- Mock or stub external dependencies in unit tests
