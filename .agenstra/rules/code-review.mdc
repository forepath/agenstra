# Code Review Process and Standards

## Review Guidelines

- **Mandatory Reviews:** All changes require at least one code review approval
- **Responsibility:** Authors responsible for shepherding PR through review
- **Respect:** Feedback should be constructive, not personal

## Review Checklist

**Automated Checks (Should be automated):**
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines (linter passes)
- [ ] No known security vulnerabilities (dependency scan)
- [ ] Code coverage meets threshold

**Functional Review:**
- [ ] Does the code solve the intended problem?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Is error handling appropriate?
- [ ] Are there N+1 queries or performance issues?

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] Is the code readable and maintainable?
- [ ] Does it follow SOLID principles?
- [ ] Is it DRY (no unnecessary duplication)?
- [ ] Are variable/function names descriptive?
- [ ] Is the code complexity reasonable?

**Testing:**
- [ ] Are there appropriate unit tests?
- [ ] Do integration tests verify interactions?
- [ ] Are edge cases tested?
- [ ] Is test coverage adequate?

**Security:**
- [ ] Are inputs validated on server side?
- [ ] Are there no hardcoded secrets?
- [ ] Is sensitive data handled securely?
- [ ] Are auth/permissions checked correctly?

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Code is self-documenting where possible?
- [ ] Complex logic is commented?
- [ ] Are breaking API changes documented?
- [ ] Is documentation updated?

## Review Feedback

- **Specific Issues:** Point out specific lines and explain the issue
- **Actionable:** Provide clear guidance on how to fix
- **Questions:** Ask clarifying questions if intent is unclear
- **Praise:** Acknowledge good solutions and learning
- **Suggestions:** Use "suggestion" mode for non-critical improvements
- **Blocking:** Use blocking comments only for critical issues

## Response Time

- **First Review:** Within 24 hours
- **Follow-up:** Respond to feedback within 24 hours
- **Unblocking:** Remove review block only after concerns addressed

## Continuous Improvement

- **Metrics:** Track review cycle time, comments per review
- **Patterns:** Identify recurring issues and address with guidelines
- **Learning:** Use reviews as teaching opportunities
- **Tooling:** Continuously improve review tools and automation
