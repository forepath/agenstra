# Skills

Domain-specific knowledge (patterns, best practices) as **MDC** (`.skill.mdc`) in `.agenstra/skills/`.

## Purpose

Skills document reusable expertise (e.g. TypeScript patterns, testing strategies) that agents can load when relevant. Tools that support separate skill files get one file per skill; tools that do not receive skills merged into rules or instructions during transformation.

## Structure

- **Location**: `.agenstra/skills/`
- **Format**: MDC (`.skill.mdc`) – YAML frontmatter + body
- **Naming**: Descriptive name (e.g. `design-patterns.skill.mdc`, `testing-patterns.skill.mdc`)

The **filename stem** (without `.skill.mdc`) is the skill key. The **body** is the skill content emitted by the transformers.

## Frontmatter (metadata)

Optional metadata between `---` is read by the reader and available in the context; transformers do not use it (they derive descriptions from content as needed).

| Field         | Type   | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | string | Optional identifier (key is filename stem) |
| `name`        | string | Optional display name                      |
| `description` | string | Optional short description                 |

## Content guidelines

- **Self-contained** – Each file should be understandable without requiring other skills.
- **Structured** – Use headings, lists, and code blocks so agents can parse and apply the content.
- **Referential** – You may reference rules or other docs; avoid duplicating long passages.

## Example

```mdc

id: design-patterns
name: Design Patterns
description: Reusable patterns and trade-offs

# Design Patterns

## Factory Pattern

**When to use:** Creating objects of similar types with varying logic.

### Trade-offs

- Reduces coupling; adds an abstraction layer.
```

## Output by tool

- **Cursor** – One folder per skill under `.cursor/skills/<name>/` with a `SKILL.md` file (frontmatter: `name`, `description`).
- **OpenCode** – Skills are not emitted by the transformer; see OpenCode docs for native skill configuration.
- **GitHub Copilot** – Skills are merged into `.github/instructions/skills.instructions.md` (repository-wide) because Copilot does not support separate skill files.
